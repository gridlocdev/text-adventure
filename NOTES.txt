Next Steps: 

{{ The sequencer is done, now all that's left is: }} 

MVP:
- Replace the storyCreator tabs with v-stepper

- Add form validation for StoryCreator 
: Make sure that all fields aren't empty before you submit
: 

- On the Start screen, use the v-hover component to make it do cool stuff
: When you hover on the active one, do nothing.
: When you hover an inactive story, make a "select" overlay
: If you hover the "Add Story", make an overlay with two buttons. "Create", and "Import"

- Add functionality for the Close buttons (Or hide the non chapter ones for now)

- Add routing for StoryCreator tabs

- Add Saving to the chapter components
: : Add a label next to the component name (Intro) that lists -unsaved or -saved in a muted red or green.
: : On mouse out (@onmouseout), save. 
: : Also save when the user clicks the unsaved label. 

- Use the draggables library to allow dragging of the chapter components.
: : Add a "mdi-drag" icon to the top center of each section.
: : When you begin to drag something, use the CSS property { cursor: move } 
: : https://sortablejs.github.io/Vue.Draggable/#/ <- Vue Draggable library
- Finish my story, and add it into the ChapterSequencer.
- In the TextSection, add an indicator for how many sections are left. (Small dots at the bottom of the screen, that each fill up once you proceed.)

Optional: (If people ask for it) - Add a Back arrow to the TextSequencer component to go to last text

- Documentation: 
: In each component, at the top, list what the component does in a comment.

Pages to have post-release: 

- Story manager : Edit which of your stories are stored in localStorage

- About : A short description of the application and why I built it

- Make it mobile responsive
