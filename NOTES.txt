Next Steps: 

{{The sequencer is done, now all that's left is: }} 

- Clean up my Code: 
: Remove unnecessary Console.log statements
: Remove all components from the Router except for Home and Chapter 1
: Re-organize my Components, remove the "Test" folder and hierarchy the others


- Create the ChapterSequencer component: 
: Sets the Route for the chapters. 
: Takes in the full JSON and sends just the chapter's JSON to the Sequencer.
: Handles ChapterChange events from the Sequencer, and re-sends the data to the Sequencer.

- Create and add the Sound Effects
- Modify the Light and Dark mode appearance

- Documentation: 
: In each component, at the top, list what the component does in a comment.
