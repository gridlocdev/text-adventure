Next Steps: 

{{ The sequencer is done, now all that's left is: }} 

MVP:
- Bugtest the Chapter routing
- Add a Privacy Policy (In the navbar, at the bottom)
: All data is stored locally on your browser. The storage there is cached, and is used to persist your story progress through refreshes and when the browser is closed. 
: If you would like to reset it, click "Reset Story Progress" in Settings, or you can also reset it through your browser options.
- In Settings, add a button for "Reset Story Progress"
: This should clear out the LocalStorage for that chapter's stuff
- Finish my story, and add it into the ChapterSequencer.

Bonus Goal:
- User-created stories.
: 1 - Create Story JSON page
: : Drag and drop story sections to create a story
: : Select your chapter's name, icon, and description
: : Export it as JSON, so the user can save it and load a new story
: 2 - Load Story JSON page
: : Create the Story JSON in the VueX State
: : In ChapterSequencer, initialize it to the State and set a watcher
: : After loaded, add a new item to the navbar list

Optional: (If people ask for it) - Add a Back arrow to the TextSequencer component to go to last text

- Documentation: 
: In each component, at the top, list what the component does in a comment.
