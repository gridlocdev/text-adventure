Next Steps: 

{{ The sequencer is done, now all that's left is: }} 

MVP:
- Replace the Textboxes in textSection with v-textarea https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/textareas/#misc
- Replace the ChoiceSection question text with a v-textarea as well.
- Add Saving to the chapter components
: : Add a label next to the component name (Intro) that lists -unsaved or -saved in a muted red or green.
: : On mouse out (@onmouseout), save. 
: : Also save when the user clicks the unsaved label. 
- Create the events that send the data to the Chapter component
- Create the event that transfers the data from Chapter to the StoryCreator component.
- Add the component that allows you to add these components to the chapter.
- Use the draggables library to allow dragging of the chapter components.
: : When you begin to drag something, use the CSS property { cursor: move } 
: : https://sortablejs.github.io/Vue.Draggable/#/ <- Vue Draggable library
- Finish my story, and add it into the ChapterSequencer.
- In the TextSection, add an indicator for how many sections are left. (Small dots at the bottom of the screen, that each fill up once you proceed.)

Bonus Goal:
- User-created stories.
: 1 - Create Story JSON page
: : Drag and drop story sections to create a story
: : Select your chapter's name, icon, and description
: : Export it as JSON, so the user can save it and load a new story
: 2 - Load Story JSON page
: : Create the Story JSON in the VueX State
: : In ChapterSequencer, initialize it to the State and set a watcher
: : After loaded, add a new item to the navbar list

Objective: 

- Create two draggable lists. One to contain elements to add to, and the other as a static list of items to select from.


- NewStorySections
- SectionList

When you drag things from the SectionList, it should set the item you're dragging to contain a data payload to be dropped. 

When it gets dropped, it will add something to the JSON in a specific index.\


Drop types: 

AddChapter: 
{
    ${chapterName} : { MainSections: [{}]}
}
[[
const chapterName = `'Chapter${this.ChapterDropIndex}`
]]

Intro: 
{
    title: ''
    subtext: ''
}
[[

]]

TextSection: 

[
{ text: '' },

]


ChoiceSection: 
{
ChoiceSection1: {
    text: "",
    choices: {
	    choice1: "",
	    choice2: "",
    },
    choicesMetadata: {
	    correctChoice: number,
	    gameOverText: "",
	    successText: "",
				},
},
}

Ending: 

{
    title: "",
    subText: "",
}



Optional: (If people ask for it) - Add a Back arrow to the TextSequencer component to go to last text

- Documentation: 
: In each component, at the top, list what the component does in a comment.
