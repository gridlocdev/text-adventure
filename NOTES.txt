Next Steps: 

{{ The sequencer is done, now all that's left is: }} 

MVP:

- Add the "mdi-" textbox prefix to the Chapter Icon selector like it is in Story Details

- On the Start screen, use the v-hover component to make it do cool stuff
: When you hover on the active one, do nothing.
: When you hover an inactive story, make a "select" overlay
: If you hover the "Add Story", make an overlay with two buttons. "Create", and "Import"

- Have the "Reset Story Progress" button in Settings not remove everything from the user's StoryLibrary 

- Edit the Vuetify color theme to look like how it does when I use Dark Reader

- Add some load in animations for the newly added pages (StoryCreator, Import, and Story Library)

- About : A short description of the application and why I built it

Post MVP Release:

- Edit Story page (Copy of StoryCreator, but instead of create new it allows you to edit)

- Add a list of buttons to allow users to navigate the TextSection back and forth
: v-pagination - https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/paginations/#usage

- Documentation: 
: In each component, at the top, list what the component does in a comment.

- Make it mobile responsive

- Use the draggables library to allow dragging of the chapter components.
: : Add a "mdi-drag" icon to the top center of each section.
: : When you begin to drag something, use the CSS property { cursor: move } 
: : https://sortablejs.github.io/Vue.Draggable/#/ <- Vue Draggable library

- Finish my story, and add it into the ChapterSequencer.

- In the TextSection, add an indicator for how many sections are left. (Small dots at the bottom of the screen, that each fill up once you proceed.)

ChapterIconList: ['mdi-crown-outline', 'mdi-bridge', 'mdi-sword-cross', 'mdi-wizard-hat', 'mdi-image-filter-hdr'],
