Next Steps: 

{{ The sequencer is done, now all that's left is: }} 

MVP:
- Fix some bugs with the LocalStorage: 
: Make the settings on Settings visible as they were set. Dark Mode, Text Speed, etc;
- Fix the Reset Local Cache: 
: When it resets the local cache, make sure it keeps the "Dark Mode" and "Text Speed" cached. In that reset function, set those two from the state to a local variable and then re-set them to local storage after cache is cleared.
- Finish my story, and add it into the ChapterSequencer.

Bonus Goal:
- User-created stories.
: 1 - Create Story JSON page
: : Drag and drop story sections to create a story
: : Select your chapter's name, icon, and description
: : Export it as JSON, so the user can save it and load a new story
: 2 - Load Story JSON page
: : Create the Story JSON in the VueX State
: : In ChapterSequencer, initialize it to the State and set a watcher
: : After loaded, add a new item to the navbar list

Optional: (If people ask for it) - Add a Back arrow to the TextSequencer component to go to last text

- Documentation: 
: In each component, at the top, list what the component does in a comment.
