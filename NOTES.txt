Next Steps: 

{{ The sequencer is done, now all that's left is: }} 

MVP:
- Set up a default story


Post MVP Release:

- Edit Story page (Copy of StoryCreator, but instead of create new it allows you to edit)

- In StoryCreator/StoryEditor, the choice buttons should start as a default, and the user has to select one. 
: This should prevent people from making every answer "Answer 1"

- Add a back button to allow users to navigate the TextSection back and forth


- Make it mobile responsive

- Use the draggables library to allow dragging of the chapter components.
: : Add a "mdi-drag" icon to the top center of each section.
: : When you begin to drag something, use the CSS property { cursor: move } 
: : https://sortablejs.github.io/Vue.Draggable/#/ <- Vue Draggable library

- Finish my story, and add it into the ChapterSequencer.


ChapterIconList: ['mdi-crown-outline', 'mdi-bridge', 'mdi-sword-cross', 'mdi-wizard-hat', 'mdi-image-filter-hdr'],
