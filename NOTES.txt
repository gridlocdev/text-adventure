Next Steps: 

{{ The sequencer is done, now all that's left is: }} 

MVP:

- In the StoryCreator, add the ability to add and modify the icon for each chapter. 
- After clicking the Plus button on TextSection, focus onto the textbox at the bottom.

- Add sub-url on the StoryCreator tab for each tab type, that way I can router link to it from the Home page.


- Add Saving to the chapter components
: : Add a label next to the component name (Intro) that lists -unsaved or -saved in a muted red or green.
: : On mouse out (@onmouseout), save. 
: : Also save when the user clicks the unsaved label. 

- Use the draggables library to allow dragging of the chapter components.
: : Add a "mdi-drag" icon to the top center of each section.
: : When you begin to drag something, use the CSS property { cursor: move } 
: : https://sortablejs.github.io/Vue.Draggable/#/ <- Vue Draggable library
- Finish my story, and add it into the ChapterSequencer.
- In the TextSection, add an indicator for how many sections are left. (Small dots at the bottom of the screen, that each fill up once you proceed.)

Optional: (If people ask for it) - Add a Back arrow to the TextSequencer component to go to last text

- Documentation: 
: In each component, at the top, list what the component does in a comment.
