Next Steps: 

- Create an Ending component.

- Create events that emit from each sub-component: Intro, Typewriter, ChoiceSection, Ending
: Once this event emitted was received by the Sequencer component, have it update its data appropriately to match what it was sent.

- Add a method to the Sequencer component to create a skeleton of the chapter timeline
: Loop through the jsonPayload and count the number of each instance of the base components. 
: 

const inputJSON = JSON.parse(this.jsonPayload);
      const chapterJSON = inputJSON.MainSections[0];

      // Loop through the JSON to find our pre-defined elements.

      for (const section in chapterJSON) {
        if (section.includes("Intro")) {
          console.log("Introduction: " + section);
        } else if (section.includes("TextSection")) {
          console.log("TextSection: " + section);
        } else if (section.includes("ChoiceSection")) {
          console.log("ChoiceSection: " + section);
        } else if (section.includes("Ending")) {
          console.log("Ending: " + section);
        }
      }
