Next Steps: 

{{ The sequencer is done, now all that's left is: }} 

MVP:
- Fix the bug with the router
: To reproduce - Go through the story until you hit chapter 2, and then do a router action. 
: : If you refresh the page, the URL updates from 2 to 1, when it shouldn't.
: : If you use the NavBar link, it updates back to 2 like it should.

: : : In short, refreshing doesn't hit my BeforeEach router function.
- Finish my story, and add it into the ChapterSequencer.

Bonus Goal:
- User-created stories.
: 1 - Create Story JSON page
: : Drag and drop story sections to create a story
: : Select your chapter's name, icon, and description
: : Export it as JSON, so the user can save it and load a new story
: 2 - Load Story JSON page
: : Create the Story JSON in the VueX State
: : In ChapterSequencer, initialize it to the State and set a watcher
: : After loaded, add a new item to the navbar list

Optional: (If people ask for it) - Add a Back arrow to the TextSequencer component to go to last text

- Documentation: 
: In each component, at the top, list what the component does in a comment.
